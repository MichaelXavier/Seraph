* Seraph
** Overview
   Seraph is an experiment with rewriting
   [Angel](http://github.com/michaelxavier/Angel) for the sake of
   simplicity and testability. You shouldn't use this in production.
** Tasks
*** TODO renaming processes that were running not handled well
    Config changes should kill first before modifying the config
*** TODO numbering expansion (i.e. counts) not working right
    spawning and removing a count of process "foo" will complain unknown process foo-1
*** TODO ensure that logger processes get killed like in upstream
*** TODO ensure the timing constraint in testing is not an issue
*** TODO Use a newtype and the reader/writer typeclasses for OracleM
*** TODO Sequence on directives?
*** TODO Clean up cabal file
*** TODO reformat all modules
